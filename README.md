# Business Understanding
A fictional house flipping company has hired me to analyze the King County Housing Market and provide three recommendations based on the trends of the housing market. I will be providing insights on what features to look for when buying a house and the best remodeling options. This will allow the company to increase profits when it resells the house.

# Objectives
For this project, I will be using a Multivariate Linear Regression model to provide my recommendations. The model will help in understanding the relationship between our features (number of bedrooms, grade, etc.) on our dependent variable (the house price).

# Recommendations
Here is a quick look at my final recommendations

Features to consider when buying:
- waterfront
- View
- in_bellevue


Features that can be remodeled:
- Condition
- Floors
- Bathrooms
The notebook will show my process and provide more in depth recommendations
